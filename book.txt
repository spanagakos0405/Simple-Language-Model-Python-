This file can have anything within it. It is merely used in order to take a word, as well as a previous word, to form sentences. In other words, the code will take each word pair and form a dictionary with one word that shows up in this file as the key, and a nested dictionary as the value. In said nested dictionary, lies the word pair that comes up in this file, and the amount of times it shows up in this text file. It is shown as a percentage. All of the percentages in the values section add up to one.
