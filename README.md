(Note: The other are uploaed in order to make sure the rest of the main function doesn't get messed up. Main was built to support many different functions, but generate sentence was created by myself)<br>
<br>
In order to run the main function, it needs to be through the terminal<br>
<br>
Input: --> python main.py -i book.txt <--
